* Version 0.9.5

This is a bugfix release.

** Hard dependency on the gnome icon theme removed

Grotesque should now be more general in its usage of system icons.

** Default window size increased

The default window size was too small, resulting in elements of the
user interface being truncated when first running the program.

* Version 0.9.4

This is a general bugfix release.  Many changes were made simply to
ease future developments.

** Grotesque now depends on pyifbabel

The library handling the Treaty of Babel functionality is now being
provided independently as pyifbabel.  It must be installed to use
Grotesque.  You can find it at http://pyifbabel.invergo.net

** Support for GTK+ 2 dropped

Grotesque now only supports GTK+ 3.  While this is unfortunate,
retaining support for both versions proved unfeasible.

** Several GTK-related bugs were fixed

Grotesque was sadly out-of-date with respect to developments in the
GTK+ library.  Several fixes were implemented to bring the program
up-to-date, to prevent crashes and to avoid warnings.

** Library import/export added

In anticipation of major upcoming structural changes to Grotesque,
library import/export to IFiction has been (re-)implemented.
Exporting the library retains all of the changes you've made,
including ratings and played status.

** Story file names are now editable

In the "Edit" dialog, you can now manually set/change the location of
the story file.

** Basic HTML in story metadata is parsed

Some metadata imported from IFDB will occasionally have HTML tags in
it.  Grotesque will now parse basic text-formatting tags and will
apply the appropriate formatting.

* Version 0.9.3
** Fixed IFID extraction/computation in TADS and ZCODE games
** Fixed IFID extraction/computation and metadata extraction from blorbed files
** Added IFID computation for AGT, Alan, DOS executable, Hugo, Level 9 and Magnetic Scrolls story formats
** Added coverart extraction for TADS and blorbed story formats
** Added support for local coverart (cover art stored in the same folder as the story file, which must have the word "cover" somewhere in its name and be a JPEG or PNG image)
** Added a field for story TUID and the ability to search the IFDB by TUID in the edit dialog
** Removed Python 2.7 dependencies (2.6 is now the required version)
** Fixed bug in improper clearing of filter values when removing stories from the library
** Fixed wonky progress dialog behavior when handling large file names
** Fixed a bug in which editing a story's genre or authors resulted in spurious filter values
** Fixed a bug in which edits made via searching IFDB didn't appear in the library list.
** Fixed a bug in zeroes being ommited from custom format file extensions.
** Fixed the install location of the README and COPYING documents on Linux
** Changed the default location of the configuration files in Linux

They're now in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/grotesque, which defaults to
/home/<user>/.config/grotesque if the environment variable is not set,
and the data files to $XDG_DATA_HOME/grotesque, or
/home/<user>/.local/share/grotesque
  
!!NOTE!! 
Linux users, pay attention to that last one. You must manually move
~/.grotesque/grotesque.cfg to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/grotesque and you must move
local_library.dat and the covers folder to $XDG_DATA_HOME.
I could have done this automatically but I do not like the idea of moving
files around in your home directory without you knowing.
